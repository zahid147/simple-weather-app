# simple-weather-app

This is my very first android application made with gradle/Java. This simple weather app uses the geo-location of the smartphone and make an API call based on the location of the user. Then it fech some realtime data like temparature, wind speed, humidity etc. and show them in a single screen.

That's all I am very excited to grow my knowlegde more in app developement field.
Any suggestions will be appriciated...
